# 注意 Notice

沒事別到淘寶和蝦皮買字體，字體授權完全不明

don’t go to Taobao and Shopee to buy fonts, the authorization of fonts is completely unknown

如果看到喜歡的字體，請用圖片搜尋字體，或者打字體名稱搜他們的價格和授權，建議親自去問字體作者

If you see a font you like, please use the picture to search for the font, or type the font name to search for their price and authorization. It is recommended to ask the font author in person

看到盜賣字體，請檢舉和負評！

If you see pirated and sold fonts, please report and negatively comment!

再說一遍，不要貪心懶惰，去二次盜賣字體

Say it again, don't be greedy and lazy, go steal and sell fonts for the second time

盜賣字體會得到不明的訴訟，由你承擔，我不負責！盜賣是一種活該，別做貪心的傻事

Stealing and selling fonts will lead to unknown lawsuits, which will be borne by you, and I will not be responsible! Stealing is what you deserve, don't do greedy stupid things

改字補字是非常辛苦，免費分享超佛心，請你腳踏實地的工作

It is very hard work to change characters and make up characters. Please share the super-Buddhist heart for free. Please work hard

做中文字體比任何字更辛苦，我非常謝謝這些人為網路世界貢獻

Making Chinese fonts is harder than any other characters. I am very grateful to these people for their contributions to the Internet world.

贊助，只是更有活力做字體，可以給飯送他們

Sponsorship, just more energetic to make fonts, you can send them to the meal

其實一些開源字體，有被Google贊助，才會有好看的字體無憂使用

In fact, some open source fonts are sponsored by Google, so there will be good-looking fonts to use without worry
